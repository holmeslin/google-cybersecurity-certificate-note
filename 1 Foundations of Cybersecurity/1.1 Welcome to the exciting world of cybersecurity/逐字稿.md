## Introduction to cybersecurity

### 1.1.1

Imagine that you're preparing for a storm.
想像你正在為暴風雨做準備。
You've received notification that a storm is coming.
你已收到暴風雨即將來臨的通知。
You prepare by gathering the tools and materials you'll need to stay safe.
你透過收集確保自身安全所需的工具和物資來做準備。
You make sure your windows and doors are secure.
你確保門窗牢固。
You assemble a first aid kit, tools, food and water.
你準備了急救箱、工具、食物和水。You're prepared.
你準備好了。
The storm hits and there are powerful winds and heavy rain.
暴風雨來襲，伴隨著強風和豪雨。
The storm is using its force to try and breach your home.
暴風雨正試圖用它的力量侵襲你的家。
You notice some water leaks and begin patching them quickly in order to minimize any risk or potential damage.
你注意到一些漏水，並開始迅速修補它們，以盡量減少任何風險或潛在的損害。
Handling a security incident is no different.
處理安全事件也是如此。
Organizations must prepare for the storm by ensuring they have the tools to mitigate and quickly respond to outside threats.
組織必須透過確保擁有減輕和快速應對外部威脅的工具來為風暴做好準備。
The objective is to minimize risk and potential damage.
目標是盡量減少風險和潛在的損害。
As a security analyst, you'll work to protect your organization and the people it serves from a variety of risks and outside threats.
作為一名安全分析師，你將致力於保護你的組織及其服務的對象免受各種風險和外部威脅。
And if a threat does get through, you and your team will provide a solution to remedy the situation.
如果威脅確實滲透進來，你和你的團隊將提供解決方案來補救這種情況。
To help you better understand what this means, we'll define security and discuss the roles of security professionals in organizations.
為了幫助你更好地理解這意味著什麼，我們將定義安全性並討論安全專業人員在組織中的角色。
Let's start with some definitions: Cybersecurity, or security, is the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.
讓我們先從一些定義開始：網路安全，或安全性，是一種透過保護網路、設備、人員和數據免受未經授權的訪問或犯罪利用，來確保資訊的機密性、完整性和可用性的實踐。
For example, requiring complex passwords to access sites and services improves confidentiality by making it much more difficult for a threat actor to compromise them.
例如，要求使用複雜的密碼來訪問網站和服務，透過使威脅者更難入侵它們，來提高機密性。
A threat actor is any person or group who presents a security risk.
威脅者是指任何造成安全風險的個人或團體。
Now that you know the definition of security, let's discuss what security teams do for an organization.
既然你已經了解安全的定義，我們來討論安全團隊為組織做些什麼。
Security protects against external and internal threats.
安全防範外部和內部威脅。
An external threat is someone outside of the organization trying to gain access to private information, networks or devices.
外部威脅是指組織外部的人試圖存取私人資訊、網路或設備。
An internal threat comes from current or former employees, external vendors, or trusted partners.
內部威脅來自現任或前任員工、外部供應商或受信任的合作夥伴。
Often these internal threats are accidental, such as an employee clicking on a compromised link in an email.
通常這些內部威脅是意外發生的，例如員工點擊電子郵件中受感染的連結。
Other times, the internal actor intentionally engages in activities such as unauthorized data access or abusing systems for personal use.
其他時候，內部人員會故意從事未經授權的數據存取或為了個人使用而濫用系統等活動。
Experienced security professionals will help organizations mitigate or reduce the impact of threats like these.
經驗豐富的安全專業人員將幫助組織減輕或降低此類威脅的影響。
Security teams also ensure an organization meets regulatory compliance, or laws and guidelines, that require the implementation of specific security standards.
安全團隊還確保組織符合法規遵循，即需要實施特定安全標準的法律和準則。
Ensuring that organizations are in compliance may allow them to avoid fines and audits, while also upholding their ethical obligation to protect users.
確保組織符合法規可以使他們避免罰款和審計，同時也履行其保護使用者的道德義務。
Security teams also maintain and improve business productivity.
安全團隊還維護和提高業務生產力。
By establishing a plan for business continuity, security teams allow people to do their jobs, even in the case of something like a data breach.
透過建立業務連續性計畫，即使發生像數據洩露之類的事情，安全團隊也能讓人們繼續工作。
Being security conscious can also reduce expenses associated with risks, such as recovering from data loss or operational downtime, and potentially avoiding fines.
具有安全意識還可以減少與風險相關的費用，例如從數據丟失或營運停機中恢復，並可能避免罰款。
The last benefit of security that we'll discuss is maintaining brand trust.
我們將討論的最後一個安全的好處是維護品牌信任。
If services or customer data are compromised, this can lower trust in the organization, damage the brand, and hurt the business in the long term.
如果服務或客戶數據遭到洩露，這可能會降低對組織的信任，損害品牌，並在長期內損害業務。
Loss of customer trust may also lead to less revenue for the business.
失去客戶信任也可能導致企業收入減少。
Now, let's go over some common security-based roles.
現在，讓我們來看看一些常見的基於安全性的角色。
After completing this certificate program, here are some job titles you may want to search for: **Security analyst or specialist**, **Cybersecurity analyst or specialist**, **Security operation center or SOC analyst**, **Information security analyst**.
完成此證書課程後，以下是你可能想要搜尋的一些職位名稱：安全分析師或專家、網路安全分析師或專家、安全營運中心或 SOC 分析師、資訊安全分析師。
You'll also learn more about the responsibilities associated with some of these job titles later in the program.
你還將在本課程的後續內容中了解更多與其中一些職位相關的職責。
As you may now realize, the field of security includes many topics and concepts and every activity you complete in this program moves you one step closer to a new job.
你現在可能已經意識到，安全領域包含許多主題和概念，你在本課程中完成的每一項活動都會讓你離新工作更近一步。Let's keep learning together.
讓我們一起繼續學習。

Our teams protect Google and its users from serious threats.
我們的團隊保護 Google 及其使用者免受嚴重威脅。
Usually government-backed attackers, coordinated influence operations and serious cybercrime threat actors.
通常是政府支持的攻擊者、有組織的影響力行動和嚴重的網路犯罪威脅者。
I grew up as an army brat.
我從小就是個軍人子弟。
My dad was in the military and we moved around a lot.
我父親在軍隊服役，我們經常搬家。
I've always had an interest in security sort of generally.
我一直對廣義的安全方面很感興趣。
I got really hooked on international relations when I was in high school.
我高中時非常著迷於國際關係。
I did a lot of Model United Nations.
我參加了很多模擬聯合國。
And that really sort of brought these two things together for me, the way that security works in the world.
這真的將這兩件事結合在一起，也就是安全在世界上的運作方式。
I come from a big family.
我來自一個大家庭。
I knew I was going to need financial assistance to go to college.
我知道我需要經濟援助才能上大學。
And the Department of Defense provides a lot of educational opportunities that are tied to service.
國防部提供了許多與服役相關的教育機會。
So this was a natural fit for me.
所以這對我來說是很自然的選擇。
I knew I was interested in this area and this was going to provide a career path into something I was passionate about.
我知道我對這個領域感興趣，而這將提供一條通往我熱衷領域的職業道路。
I started as an intelligence analyst, but not focused on cybersecurity.
我最初是擔任情報分析師，但並非專注於網路安全。
I worked counterinsurgency for a number of years and geopolitical intelligence issues.
我從事了數年的反叛亂工作和地緣政治情報議題。
Eventually, as I looked and saw that the way that cybersecurity was starting to have an impact both in our daily lives and in that world of international relations, I got more and more drawn to it.
最終，當我觀察到網路安全開始對我們的日常生活和國際關係領域產生影響時，我越來越被它吸引。
Transitioning into cybersecurity was a huge shift for me.
轉型到網路安全對我來說是一個巨大的轉變。
I came in without a solid technical background, had to learn a lot of that on the job and through self-paced learning in different types of courses, I needed to learn programming languages like Python and SQL, two of the things that we cover in this certificate, I needed to learn a whole new language about the vocabulary of threats and the different components and how those manifest technically.
我進入這個領域時沒有紮實的技術背景，必須在工作中以及透過不同類型課程的自學來學習很多東西，我需要學習像 Python 和 SQL 這樣的程式語言，這也是我們在這個證書課程中涵蓋的兩個重點，我需要學習一套關於威脅的詞彙、不同的組成部分以及這些組成部分如何在技術上呈現的全新語言。
One of the things that I had to figure out very early in this journey is what kind of learner I was.
我在這段旅程的早期就必須弄清楚自己是哪種類型的學習者。
I work best with a structured learning style.
我最適合有結構的學習方式。
So turning to a lot of these online courses and resources that took this material and structured it sort of from first principles through application resonated very well for me.
因此，許多將這些材料從基本原理到應用進行結構化的線上課程和資源對我產生了很好的共鳴。
A lot of this was also learned on the job by co-workers who were willing to share and invest time in helping me understand this.
很多東西也是在工作中從願意分享並投入時間幫助我理解這些的同事那裡學到的。
I asked a lot of questions and I still do.
我問了很多問題，而且我現在仍然如此。
Most of cybersecurity work is going to be learned on the job in the specific environment that you're protecting.
大多數的網路安全工作都是在你要保護的特定環境中透過實務學習的。
So you have to work well with your teammates in order to be able to build that knowledge base.
因此，你必須與你的隊友良好合作，才能建立起知識庫。
My advice would be to stay curious and keep learning, especially focusing on your technical skills and growing those throughout your career.
我的建議是保持好奇心並持續學習，尤其要專注於你的技術技能並在你的整個職業生涯中不斷發展這些技能。
It's really easy to get imposter syndrome in cybersecurity because it's so broad and mastery of all these different areas is a lifetime's work.
在網路安全領域很容易產生冒名頂替者症候群，因為它非常廣泛，要掌握所有這些不同的領域需要一生的時間。
And sometimes that imposter syndrome can shut us down and make it feel like, why bother trying to keep growing.
有時這種冒名頂替者症候群會讓我們停滯不前，讓我們覺得，為什麼還要繼續努力成長。
I'm never going to be able to master this instead of motivating us.
我永遠無法掌握它，而不是激勵我們。
So keep learning, push through that fear.
所以繼續學習，克服那種恐懼。
The efforts always going to be rewarded.
努力總會得到回報的。

### 1.1.3 Responsibilities of an entry-level cybersecurity analyst

Technology is rapidly changing and so are the tactics and techniques that attackers use.
科技日新月異，攻擊者使用的策略和技術也在不斷變化。
As digital infrastructure evolves, security professionals are expected to continually grow their skills in order to protect and secure sensitive information.
隨著數位基礎設施的發展，安全專業人員需要不斷提升技能，以保護和確保敏感資訊的安全。
In this video, we'll discuss some job responsibilities of an entry-level security analyst.
在本影片中，我們將討論初級安全分析師的一些工作職責。
So, what do security analysts do? Security analysts are responsible for monitoring and protecting information and systems.
那麼，安全分析師是做什麼的？安全分析師負責監控和保護資訊和系統。
Now, we'll discuss three primary responsibilities of a security analyst, starting with protecting computer and network systems.
現在，我們將討論安全分析師的三個主要職責，首先是保護電腦和網路系統。
Protecting computer and network systems requires an analyst to monitor an organization's internal network.
保護電腦和網路系統需要分析師監控組織的內部網路。
If a threat is detected, then an analyst is generally the first to respond.
如果偵測到威脅，分析師通常是第一個回應的人。
Analysts also often take part in exercises to search for weaknesses in an organization's own systems.
分析師也經常參與演練，以尋找組織自身系統中的弱點。
For example, a security analyst may contribute to penetration testing or ethical hacking.
例如，安全分析師可能會參與滲透測試或道德駭客攻擊。
The goal is to penetrate or hack their own organization's internal network to identify vulnerabilities and suggest ways to strengthen their security measures.
目標是滲透或駭入他們自己組織的內部網路，以識別漏洞並提出加強其安全措施的方法。
Think of it like this.
這樣想一下。
After you lock your car, you check the door handles to make sure no one can access any valuables you keep inside.
你鎖上車後，會檢查門把手，以確保沒有人可以拿到你放在裡面的任何貴重物品。
Security analysts also proactively work to prevent threats from happening in the first place.
安全分析師也會主動工作以從一開始就預防威脅發生。
One way they do this is by working with information technology, or IT, teams to install prevention software for the purposes of identifying risks and vulnerabilities.
他們這樣做的一種方式是與資訊技術（IT）團隊合作，安裝預防軟體，以識別風險和漏洞。
Analysts may also be involved in software and hardware development.
分析師也可能參與軟體和硬體開發。
They'll often work with development teams to support product security by setting up appropriate processes and systems to meet the organization's data protection needs.
他們經常與開發團隊合作，透過建立適當的流程和系統來滿足組織的數據保護需求，以支援產品安全。
The last task we'll discuss is conducting periodic security audits.
我們將討論的最後一項任務是進行定期安全審計。
A security audit is a review of an organization's security records, activities, and other related documents.
安全審計是對組織的安全記錄、活動和其他相關文件的審查。
For example, an analyst may examine in-house security issues, such as making sure that confidential information, like individual computer passwords, isn't available to all employees.
例如，分析師可能會檢查內部安全問題，例如確保所有員工都無法獲得機密資訊，例如個人電腦密碼。
Phew, that was a lot to cover! But hopefully you have a general idea of what entry-level security analysts do on a day-to-day basis.
哇，這涵蓋了很多內容！但希望你對初級安全分析師的日常工作有了一般性的了解。
Security analysts are an important part of any organization.
安全分析師是任何組織的重要組成部分。
Their daily tasks protect small businesses, large companies, nonprofit organizations, and government agencies.
他們的日常任務保護小型企業、大型公司、非營利組織和政府機構。
They also help to ensure that the people served by those organizations remain safe.
他們還有助於確保這些組織服務的人們保持安全。

### 1.1.4 Nikki: A day in the life of a security engineer

My name is Nikki and I'm a security engineer at Google.
我的名字是 Nikki，我是 Google 的一名安全工程師。
I am part of the insider threat detection team at Google, so my role is more focused on catching insider threats or insider suspicious activity within the company.
我是 Google 內部威脅偵測團隊的一員，所以我的職責更側重於抓捕公司內部的威脅或可疑活動。
My first experience with cybersecurity was when I was interning at the aquarium.
我第一次接觸網路安全是在水族館實習的時候。
I learned a lot of network security there, they had a lot of phishing attempts, of course, you know, at the aquarium.
我在那裡學到了很多網路安全知識，他們當然在水族館也遇到了很多網路釣魚攻擊。
My manager was really focused on making sure that our networks were secure and I learned a lot from him and that really sparked my interest in cybersecurity.
我的經理非常注重確保我們的網路安全，我從他身上學到了很多，這真的激發了我對網路安全的興趣。
The main reason I chose to pursue a career in cybersecurity is just how flexible the career path is.
我選擇從事網路安全職業的主要原因是這個職業道路非常靈活。
Once you're in security, there's so many different fields you can dive into.
一旦你進入安全領域，你就可以深入研究許多不同的領域。
Whether it's through the blue team, protecting the user or the red team, which is just, you know, poking holes in other people's defenses and letting them know where they're going wrong.
無論是透過藍隊保護使用者，還是紅隊，也就是找出其他人防禦中的漏洞並讓他們知道哪裡出錯。
A day in the life as a entry- level security professional? Um, it can change day to day, but there's two basic parts to it.
初級安全專業人員的日常工作是什麼樣的？嗯，每天都可能不同，但它基本上包含兩個部分。
There's the operation side, which is responding to detections and doing investigations.
一個是營運方面，即回應偵測結果並進行調查。
And then there's the project side where you're working with other teams to build new detections or improve the current detections.
另一個是專案方面，你與其他團隊合作建立新的偵測方法或改進現有的偵測方法。
The difference between this entry- level cybersecurity analyst and an entry-level cybersecurity engineer is pretty much that the analyst is more focused on operations and the engineer, while they can do operations, they also build the, the detections and they do more project focused work.
初級網路安全分析師和初級網路安全工程師之間的區別基本上在於，分析師更側重於營運，而工程師雖然也可以進行營運，但他們也構建偵測方法，並且做更多以專案為中心的工作。
My favorite task is probably the operations side doing investigations because we can sometimes get something like this actor did such and such on this day.
我最喜歡的任務可能是營運方面的調查工作，因為我們有時會得到類似「這個行為者在某天做了某事」的資訊。
And we're supposed to then dive into what they've been doing, what they've been working on to figure out if there's any suspicious activity or if it was just a false positive.
然後我們應該深入研究他們一直在做的事情、他們一直在進行的工作，以弄清楚是否存在任何可疑活動，或者只是誤報。
One of the biggest ways I've made an impact as an entry-level cybersecurity professional is actually working on the playbooks that, um, our team uses.
作為一名初級網路安全專業人員，我產生最大影響的方式之一實際上是參與我們團隊使用的劇本的編寫。
A playbook is a list of how to go through a certain detection, and what the analyst needs to look at in order to investigate those incidents.
劇本是一個清單，列出了如何處理某種偵測，以及分析師需要查看哪些內容才能調查這些事件。
I was really proud of those, those playbooks that I've made so far because a lot of my teammates have even said how helpful they've been to them.
我為我目前製作的那些劇本感到非常自豪，因為我的許多隊友甚至都說它們對他們有多大的幫助。
If you love solving problems, if you love protecting user data, being at the front lines of a lot of headlines, then this is definitely the role for you.
如果你熱愛解決問題，如果你熱愛保護使用者數據，並且想站在許多新聞頭條的最前線，那麼這絕對是適合你的角色。

### 1.1.5 Common cybersecurity terminology

As you’ve learned, cybersecurity (also known as security) is the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation.
正如你所學到的，網路安全（也稱為安全）是一種透過保護網路、裝置、人員和數據免受未經授權的存取或犯罪利用，來確保資訊的機密性、完整性和可用性的實踐。

In this reading, you’ll be introduced to some key terms used in the cybersecurity profession.

Additionally, an analyst works to prevent incidents.
此外，分析師還致力於預防事件發生。

In order for analysts to effectively do these types of tasks, they need to develop knowledge of the following key concepts.
為了使分析師有效地完成這些類型的工作，他們需要培養以下關鍵概念的知識。

Compliance is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.
合規性是遵守內部標準和外部法規的過程，使組織能夠避免罰款和安全漏洞。

Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
安全框架是用於制定計畫的指南，以幫助減輕數據和隱私的風險和威脅。

Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks。
They are used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture.
安全控制是旨在降低特定安全風險的保障措施。它們與安全框架一起使用，以建立強大的安全態勢。

Security posture is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change。
A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.
安全態勢是組織管理其對關鍵資產和數據的防禦以及應對變化的能力。強大的安全態勢可降低組織的風險。

A threat actor, or malicious attacker, is any person or group who presents a security risk。
This risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data.
威脅者，或惡意攻擊者，是指任何造成安全風險的個人或團體。這種風險可能與電腦、應用程式、網路和數據有關。

An internal threat can be a current or former employee, an external vendor, or a trusted partner who poses a security risk。
At times, an internal threat is accidental。
For example, an employee who accidentally clicks on a malicious email link would be considered an accidental threat。
Other times, the internal threat actor intentionally engages in risky activities, such as unauthorized data access.
內部威脅可能是構成安全風險的現任或前任員工、外部供應商或受信任的合作夥伴。有時，內部威脅是意外發生的。例如，意外點擊惡意電子郵件連結的員工將被視為意外威脅。其他時候，內部威脅者會故意從事危險活動，例如未經授權的數據存取。

Network security is the practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access。
This includes data, services, systems, and devices that are stored in an organization’s network.
網路安全是一種保護組織的網路基礎設施免受未經授權存取的實踐。這包括儲存在組織網路中的數據、服務、系統和裝置。

Cloud security is the process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured, or set up correctly, and access to those assets is limited to authorized users。
The cloud is a network made up of a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in remote physical locations known as data centers that can be accessed via the internet。
Cloud security is a growing subfield of cybersecurity that specifically focuses on the protection of data, applications, and infrastructure in the cloud.
雲端安全是確保儲存在雲端的資產已正確配置或設定，並且對這些資產的存取僅限於授權使用者的過程。雲端是由一系列伺服器或電腦組成的網路，這些伺服器或電腦將資源和數據儲存在稱為資料中心的遠端實體位置，這些位置可以透過網際網路存取。雲端安全是網路安全的一個不斷發展的子領域，專門關注雲端中數據、應用程式和基礎設施的保護。

Programming is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks。
These tasks can include:
程式設計是一個可用於為電腦建立一組特定指令以執行任務的過程。這些任務可以包括：

### 1.2.4 The importance of cybersecurity

As we've discussed, security professionals protect many physical and digital assets.
正如我們討論過的，安全專業人員保護許多實體和數位資產。

These skills are desired by organizations and government entities because risk needs to be managed.
這些技能是組織和政府實體所需要的，因為需要管理風險。

Let's continue to discuss why security matters.
讓我們繼續討論為什麼安全如此重要。

Security is essential for ensuring an organization's business continuity and ethical standing.
安全對於確保組織的業務連續性和道德聲譽至關重要。

There are both legal implications and moral considerations to maintaining an organization's security.
維護組織的安全涉及法律影響和道德考量。

A data breach, for example, affects everyone that is associated with the organization.
例如，數據洩露會影響與該組織相關的所有人。

This is because data losses or leaks can affect an organization's reputation as well as the lives and reputations of their users, clients, and customers.
這是因為數據丟失或洩露會影響組織的聲譽，以及其使用者、客戶和顧客的生活和聲譽。

By maintaining strong security measures, organizations can increase user trust.
透過維持強有力的安全措施，組織可以提高使用者信任度。

This may lead to financial growth and ongoing business referrals.
這可能會帶來財務增長和持續的業務推薦。

As previously mentioned, organizations are not the only ones that suffer during a data breach.
如前所述，組織並非數據洩露中唯一的受害者。

Maintaining and securing user, customer, and vendor data is an important part of preventing incidents that may expose people's personally identifiable information.
維護和保護使用者、客戶和供應商數據是預防可能洩露個人身分資訊的事件的重要環節。

Personally identifiable information, known as PII, is any information used to infer an individual's identity.
個人身分資訊（PII）是指用於推斷個人身分的任何資訊。

PII includes someone's full name, date of birth, physical address, phone number, email address, internet protocol, or IP address and similar information.
PII 包括某人的全名、出生日期、實際地址、電話號碼、電子郵件地址、網際網路協定或 IP 位址以及類似資訊。

Sensitive personally identifiable information, known as SPII, is a specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines and may include social security numbers, medical or financial information, and biometric data, such as facial recognition.
敏感個人身分資訊（SPII）是一種特定類型的 PII，受到更嚴格的處理準則約束，可能包括社會安全號碼、醫療或財務資訊以及生物特徵數據，例如面部辨識。

If SPII is stolen, this has the potential to be significantly more damaging to an individual than if PII is stolen.
如果 SPII 被盜，這對個人的潛在損害遠大於 PII 被盜。

PII and SPII data are key assets that a threat actor will look for if an organization experiences a breach.
PII 和 SPII 數據是威脅者在組織發生洩露時會尋找的關鍵資產。

When a person's identifiable information is compromised, leaked, or stolen, identity theft is the primary concern.
當一個人的身分資訊被洩露、洩漏或盜竊時，身分盜用是主要擔憂。

Identity theft is the act of stealing personal information to commit fraud while impersonating a victim.
身分盜用是指盜竊個人資訊以在冒充受害者的同時進行詐欺的行為。

And the primary objective of identity theft is financial gain.
而身分盜用的主要目的是為了經濟利益。

We've explored several reasons why security matters.
我們已經探討了安全如此重要的幾個原因。

Employers need security analysts like you to fill the current and future demand to protect data, products, and people while ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and safe access to information.
雇主需要像你這樣的安全分析師來滿足當前和未來的需求，以保護數據、產品和人員，同時確保資訊的機密性、完整性和安全存取。

This is why the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics expects the demand for security professionals to grow by more than 30% by the year 2030.
這就是為什麼美國勞工統計局預計到 2030 年，對安全專業人員的需求將增長超過 30%。

So keep learning, and eventually you'll be able to do your part to create a safer and more secure environment for organizations and people alike!
所以繼續學習，最終你將能夠盡自己的一份力量，為組織和人們創造一個更安全、更有保障的環境！
