然後，我們將討論事件回應的六個階段。

Let's get started!
讓我們開始吧！

### Phases of an incident response playbook 事件回應劇本的階段

Previously, we discussed how SIEM tools are used to help protect an organization's critical assets and data.
先前，我們討論了如何使用 SIEM 工具來幫助保護組織的關鍵資產和數據。

In this video, we'll introduce another important tool for maintaining an organization's security, known as a playbook.
在本影片中，我們將介紹另一個用於維護組織安全的重要工具，稱為劇本。

A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action.
劇本是提供有關任何操作動作詳細資訊的手冊。

Playbooks also clarify what tools should be used in response to a security incident.
劇本還闡明了在應對安全事件時應使用哪些工具。

In the security field, playbooks are essential.
在安全領域，劇本至關重要。

Urgency, efficiency, and accuracy are necessary to quickly identify and mitigate a security threat to reduce potential risk.
緊急性、效率和準確性對於快速識別和減輕安全威脅以降低潛在風險是必要的。

Playbooks ensure that people follow a consistent list of actions in a prescribed way, regardless of who is working on the case.
劇本確保人們以規定的方式遵循一致的行動清單，無論是誰在處理該案例。

Different types of playbooks are used.
使用不同類型的劇本。

These include playbooks for incident response, security alerts, teams-specific, and product-specific purposes.
這些包括用於事件回應、安全警報、團隊特定和產品特定用途的劇本。

Here, we'll focus on a playbook that's commonly used in cybersecurity, called an incident response playbook.
在這裡，我們將重點介紹網路安全中常用的劇本，稱為事件回應劇本。

Incident response is an organization's quick attempt to identify an attack, contain the damage, and correct the effects of a security breach.
事件回應是組織快速嘗試識別攻擊、控制損害並糾正安全漏洞影響的行為。

An incident response playbook is a guide with six phases used to help mitigate and manage security incidents from beginning to end.
事件回應劇本是一個包含六個階段的指南，用於幫助從頭到尾減輕和管理安全事件。

Let's discuss each phase.
讓我們討論每個階段。

The first phase is preparation.
第一階段是準備。

Organizations must prepare to mitigate the likelihood, risk, and impact of a security incident by documenting procedures, establishing staffing plans, and educating users.
組織必須透過記錄程序、建立人員配置計畫和教育使用者來準備減輕安全事件的可能性、風險和影響。

Preparation sets the foundation for successful incident response.
準備為成功的事件回應奠定了基礎。

For example, organizations can create incident response plans and procedures that outline the roles and responsibilities of each security team member.
例如，組織可以建立事件回應計畫和程序，概述每個安全團隊成員的角色和職責。

The second phase is detection and analysis.
第二階段是偵測和分析。

The objective of this phase is to detect and analyze events using defined processes and technology.
此階段的目標是使用定義的流程和技術來偵測和分析事件。

Using appropriate tools and strategies during this phase helps security analysts determine whether a breach has occurred and analyze its possible magnitude.
在此階段使用適當的工具和策略可幫助安全分析師確定是否發生了漏洞並分析其可能的嚴重程度。

The third phase is containment.
第三階段是控制。

The goal of containment is to prevent further damage and reduce the immediate impact of a security incident.
控制的目標是防止進一步的損害並減少安全事件的直接影響。

During this phase, security professionals take actions to contain an incident and minimize damage.
在此階段，安全專業人員會採取行動來控制事件並最大程度地減少損害。

Containment is a high priority for organizations because it helps prevent ongoing risks to critical assets and data.
控制是組織的首要任務，因為它有助於防止關鍵資產和數據面臨持續的風險。

The fourth phase in an incident response playbook is eradication and recovery.
事件回應劇本中的第四階段是清除和復原。

This phase involves the complete removal of an incident's artifacts so that an organization can return to normal operations.
此階段涉及完全清除事件的相關物件，以便組織可以恢復正常運作。

During this phase, security professionals eliminate artifacts of the incident by removing malicious code and mitigating vulnerabilities.
在此階段，安全專業人員透過移除惡意程式碼和減輕漏洞來消除事件的相關物件。

Once they've exercised due diligence, they can begin to restore the affected environment to a secure state.
一旦他們進行了適當的盡職調查，他們就可以開始將受影響的環境恢復到安全狀態。

This is also known as IT restoration.
這也稱為 IT 恢復。

The fifth phase is post-incident activity.
第五階段是事件後活動。

This phase includes documenting the incident, informing organizational leadership, and applying lessons learned to ensure that an organization is better prepared to handle future incidents.
此階段包括記錄事件、通知組織領導層，以及應用從中吸取的教訓，以確保組織更好地準備應對未來的事件。

Depending on the severity of the incident, organizations can conduct a full-scale incident analysis to determine the root cause of the incident and implement various updates or improvements to enhance its overall security posture.
根據事件的嚴重程度，組織可以進行全面性的事件分析，以確定事件的根本原因，並實施各種更新或改進以增強其整體安全態勢。

The sixth and final phase in an incident response playbook is coordination.
事件回應劇本中的第六個也是最後一個階段是協調。

Coordination involves reporting incidents and sharing information, throughout the incident response process, based on the organization's established standards.
協調涉及根據組織已建立的標準，在整個事件回應過程中報告事件和共享資訊。

Coordination is important for many reasons.
協調非常重要，原因有很多。

It ensures that organizations meet compliance requirements and it allows for coordinated response and resolution.
它確保組織符合合規性要求，並允許協調回應和解決方案。

There are many ways security professionals may be alerted to an incident.
安全專業人員可以透過多種方式收到事件警報。

You recently learned about SIEM tools and how they collect and analyze data.
您最近了解了 SIEM 工具以及它們如何收集和分析數據。

They use this data to detect threats and generate alerts, which can inform the security team of a potential incident.
它們使用這些數據來偵測威脅並產生警報，這些警報可以將潛在事件通知安全團隊。

Then, when a security analyst receives a SIEM alert, they can use the appropriate playbook to guide the response process.
然後，當安全分析師收到 SIEM 警報時，他們可以使用適當的劇本來指導回應過程。

SIEM tools and playbooks work together to provide a structured and efficient way of responding to potential security incidents.
SIEM 工具和劇本協同工作，提供了一種結構化且有效的方式來應對潛在的安全事件。

Throughout the program, you'll have opportunities to continue to build your understanding of these important concepts.
在整個課程中，您將有機會繼續建立對這些重要概念的理解。

### More about playbooks 更多關於劇本

Previously, you learned that playbooks are tools used by cybersecurity professionals to identify and respond to security issues.
先前，您已了解劇本是網路安全專業人員用來識別和回應安全問題的工具。

In this reading, you’ll learn more about playbooks and their purpose in the field of cybersecurity.
在本篇閱讀中，您將學習更多關於劇本及其在網路安全領域中的用途。

**Playbook overview**
**劇本概述**

A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action.
劇本是提供有關任何操作動作詳細資訊的手冊。

Essentially, a playbook provides a predefined and up-to-date list of steps to perform when responding to an incident.
從本質上講，劇本提供了一個預定義且最新的步驟清單，用於在回應事件時執行。

An analyst using a playbook.
分析師使用劇本。

Playbooks are accompanied by a strategy.
劇本附帶策略。

The strategy outlines expectations of team members who are assigned a task, and some playbooks also list the individuals responsible.
該策略概述了分配到任務的團隊成員的期望，有些劇本還列出了負責人員。

The outlined expectations are accompanied by a plan.
概述的期望附帶一個計畫。

The plan dictates how the specific task outlined in the playbook must be completed.
該計畫規定了必須如何完成劇本中概述的特定任務。

Playbooks should be treated as living documents, which means that they are frequently updated by security team members to address industry changes and new threats.
劇本應被視為活文件，這意味著安全團隊成員會經常更新它們，以應對行業變化和新威脅。

Playbooks are generally managed as a collaborative effort, since security team members have different levels of expertise.
由於安全團隊成員擁有不同程度的專業知識，因此劇本通常以協作方式進行管理。

Updates are often made if:
通常在以下情況下進行更新：

-   A failure is identified, such as an oversight in the outlined policies and procedures, or in the playbook itself.
    發現了失敗，例如在概述的政策和程序或劇本本身中的疏忽。
-   There is a change in industry standards, such as changes in laws or regulatory compliance.
    行業標準發生變化，例如法律或法規遵循的變化。
-   The cybersecurity landscape changes due to evolving threat actor tactics and techniques.
    由於不斷演變的威脅行為者策略和技術，網路安全環境發生變化。

**Types of playbooks**
**劇本類型**

Playbooks sometimes cover specific incidents and vulnerabilities.
劇本有時會涵蓋特定的事件和漏洞。

These might include ransomware, vishing, business email compromise (BEC), and other attacks previously discussed.
這些可能包括勒索軟體、語音網路釣魚、商業電子郵件入侵 (BEC) 和先前討論的其他攻擊。

Incident and vulnerability response playbooks are very common, but they are not the only types of playbooks organizations develop.
事件和漏洞回應劇本非常常見，但它們並不是組織開發的唯一類型的劇本。

Each organization has a different set of playbook tools, methodologies, protocols, and procedures that they adhere to, and different individuals are involved at each step of the response process, depending on the country they are in.
每個組織都有一套不同的劇本工具、方法、協定和程序，他們會遵守這些，並且根據他們所在的國家/地區，回應過程的每個步驟都涉及不同的人員。

For example, incident notification requirements from government-imposed laws and regulations, along with compliance standards, affect the content in the playbooks.
例如，政府強制執行的法律和法規中的事件通知要求，以及合規標準，會影響劇本中的內容。

These requirements are subject to change based on where the incident originated and the type of data affected.
這些要求可能會根據事件的發生地和受影響的數據類型而變化。

**Incident and vulnerability response playbooks**
**事件和漏洞回應劇本**

Incident and vulnerability response playbooks are commonly used by entry-level cybersecurity professionals.
事件和漏洞回應劇本通常由初級網路安全專業人員使用。

They are developed based on the goals outlined in an organization’s business continuity plan.
它們是根據組織的業務連續性計畫中概述的目標制定的。

A business continuity plan is an established path forward allowing a business to recover and continue to operate as normal, despite a disruption like a security breach.
業務連續性計畫是一條已建立的前進道路，允許企業在發生像安全漏洞這樣的干擾後恢復並繼續正常營運。

These two types of playbooks are similar in that they both contain predefined and up-to-date lists of steps to perform when responding to an incident.
這兩種劇本的相似之處在於它們都包含在回應事件時要執行的預定義且最新的步驟清單。

Following these steps is necessary to ensure that you, as a security professional, are adhering to legal and organizational standards and protocols.
遵循這些步驟對於確保您作為一名安全專業人員遵守法律和組織標準及協定是必要的。

These playbooks also help minimize errors and ensure that important actions are performed within a specific timeframe.
這些劇本還有助於最大程度地減少錯誤，並確保在特定時間範圍內執行重要操作。

When an incident, threat, or vulnerability occurs or is identified, the level of risk to the organization depends on the potential damage to its assets.
當事件、威脅或漏洞發生或被識別時，對組織的風險程度取決於其資產的潛在損害。

A basic formula for determining the level of risk is that risk equals the likelihood of a threat.
用於確定風險程度的基本公式是風險等於威脅的可能性。

For this reason, a sense of urgency is essential.
因此，緊迫感至關重要。

Following the steps outlined in playbooks is also important if any forensic task is being carried out.
如果要執行任何鑑識任務，遵循劇本中概述的步驟也很重要。

Mishandling data can easily compromise forensic data, rendering it unusable.
處理不當的數據很容易損害鑑識數據，使其無法使用。

Common steps included in incident and vulnerability playbooks include:

事件和漏洞劇本中包含的常見步驟包括：

-   Preparation 準備
-   Detection 偵測
-   Analysis 分析
-   Containment 控制
-   Eradication 清除
-   Recovery from an incident 從事件中復原

Additional steps include performing post-incident activities, and a coordination of efforts throughout the investigation and incident and vulnerability response stages.
其他步驟包括執行事件後活動，以及在整個調查以及事件和漏洞回應階段進行協調工作。

**Key takeaways**
**重點回顧**

It is essential to refine processes and procedures outlined in a playbook.
必須改進劇本中概述的流程和程序。

With every documented incident, cybersecurity teams need to consider what was learned from the incident and what improvements should be made to handle incidents more effectively in the future.
對於每個記錄在案的事件，網路安全團隊都需要考慮從事件中學到了什麼，以及應該進行哪些改進以在未來更有效地處理事件。

Playbooks create structure and ensure compliance with the law.
劇本建立了結構並確保符合法律。

### Zack: Incident response and the value of playbooks Zack：事件回應與劇本的價值

My name is Zack.
我叫 Zack。

I'm a Software Engineer on the security team in Google Workspace.
我是 Google Workspace 安全團隊的軟體工程師。

I have non-traditional background.
我擁有非傳統的背景。

When I graduated college, I originally thought that I would pursue law, but I was accepted and I decided not to go.
大學畢業時，我原本打算從事法律工作，但我被錄取後決定不去。

Instead, I joined Google in recruiting.
相反地，我加入了 Google 的招募部門。

Through that work, I did a little bit of strategy work where I taught myself web scraping and I really liked it, so I took one of Google's internal training courses that helped me move from recruiting to software engineering.
透過這份工作，我做了一些策略工作，在那裡我自學了網路爬蟲，我非常喜歡它，所以我參加了 Google 的內部培訓課程之一，這幫助我從招募部門轉到軟體工程部門。

Processes and playbooks are documentation that software engineers and other people at Google use to determine how we can respond to things that happen.
流程和劇本是 Google 的軟體工程師和其他人使用的文件，用於確定我們如何應對發生的事情。

Whether that's a security or privacy incident, whether that's an active attack, we have sets of guidelines or algorithms that we use to determine the best course of action to make sure that we manage people's data and security well.
無論是安全或隱私事件，還是主動攻擊，我們都有一套準則或演算法，用於確定最佳行動方案，以確保我們妥善管理人們的數據和安全。

I'm relatively new to cybersecurity.
我對網路安全來說相對較新。

I've been a software engineer here for about two years, and I don't have enough knowledge to be able to respond to every single thing that could possibly come my way when I'm on call or when I'm helping resolve a vulnerability.
我在這裡擔任軟體工程師約兩年了，當我值班或協助解決漏洞時，我沒有足夠的知識來應對可能遇到的每一件事。

The playbooks are super important to people like me and other folks who are joining the industry new because they allow you to solve the problem with the experience of a much more experienced person, basically decades of experience in your own resolution because you can rely on this playbook and other people's advice.
劇本對於像我這樣剛加入這個行業的人和其他人來說非常重要，因為它們讓您能夠以經驗豐富得多的人的經驗來解決問題，基本上是您自己解決方案中數十年的經驗，因為您可以依賴這個劇本和其他人的建議。

The kind of things that we use playbooks for our open attacks, privacy incidents, data leaks, denial of service attacks, service alerts, and others.
我們使用劇本的類型包括公開攻擊、隱私事件、數據洩露、阻斷服務攻擊、服務警報等。

When I first started out at Google, my first task on the security team was to fix an externally reported vulnerability.
當我剛開始在 Google 工作時，我在安全團隊的第一個任務是修復一個外部回報的漏洞。

That means some security researcher out in the wild was playing with our app and found something that could potentially leak our user's data.
這意味著一些在外的安全研究人員正在使用我們的應用程式，並發現了一些可能洩露使用者數據的東西。

When I received that, it was my first task on the team.
當我收到那個時，這是我在團隊的第一個任務。

Looking back on it, it's a relatively easy thing to solve, but it felt really overwhelming at the time.
現在回想起來，這是一件相對容易解決的事情，但當時感覺非常難以應付。

But when we receive a vulnerability report, it comes with remediation guidance.
但是當我們收到漏洞報告時，它會附帶補救指南。

There were steps in the bug that was sent to me saying this is the things that we think that you should do.
在發送給我的錯誤報告中有一些步驟，說明了我們認為您應該做的事情。

The things that I would say to somebody who's interested in starting out in cybersecurity is talk to as many people in the industry as you can.
我想對有興趣開始從事網路安全工作的人說的是，盡可能多地與業內人士交談。

You'll learn about what the job is like.
你會了解這份工作是什麼樣的。

You'll learn about the skills that you need to get yourself there.
你會了解你需要哪些技能才能到達那裡。

If that's something that you're interested in, you'll learn about open jobs and roles, what it's like to work at different companies.
如果您對此感興趣，您將了解空缺的職位和角色，以及在不同公司工作的情況。

I wish people had told me when I graduated college that what these jobs are really like.
我希望人們在我大學畢業時告訴我這些工作實際上是什麼樣的。

I thought that coding would be heads down, typing away at a computer and a dark office for 12 hours a day.
我以為寫程式會是埋頭苦幹，每天在黑暗的辦公室裡對著電腦打字 12 個小時。

But it's not like that at all.
但根本不是那樣的。

50% is communicating with other people and reviewing designs and talking about ideas.
50% 是與其他人溝通、審查設計和討論想法。

That's really compelling and I think if somebody had said that to me at the beginning of my career would have been totally different.
這非常引人注目，我認為如果有人在我職業生涯的開始就對我說過這些，那會完全不同。

Some teams come in and out of fashion, but security is ever-present.
有些團隊會來來去去，但安全永遠存在。

It's really important now it's only getting more important.
它現在非常重要，而且只會變得越來越重要。

There's a certain amount of security that comes with being in a security team.
加入安全團隊會帶來一定的安全感。

Definitely, a good place to be.
絕對是一個好地方。

## Explore incident response

### Use a playbook to respond to threats, risks, or vulnerabilities 使用劇本回應威脅、風險或漏洞

Welcome back! In this video, we're going to revisit SIEM tools and how they're used alongside playbooks to reduce organizational threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
歡迎回來！在本影片中，我們將重新探討 SIEM 工具以及它們如何與劇本一起使用，以減少組織的威脅、風險和漏洞。

An incident response playbook is a guide that helps security professionals mitigate issues with a heightened sense of urgency, while maintaining accuracy.
事件回應劇本是一個指南，可幫助安全專業人員以高度的緊迫感來減輕問題，同時保持準確性。

Playbooks create structure, ensure compliance, and outline processes for communication and documentation.
劇本建立了結構、確保合規性，並概述了溝通和記錄的流程。

Organizations may use different types of incident response playbooks depending on the situation.
組織可能會根據情況使用不同類型的事件回應劇本。

For example, an organization may have specific playbooks for addressing different types of attacks, such as ransomware, malware, distributed denial of service, and more.
例如，組織可能擁有用於應對不同類型攻擊的特定劇本，例如勒索軟體、惡意軟體、分散式阻斷服務等等。

To start, let's discuss how a security analyst might use a playbook to address a SIEM alert, like a potential malware attack.
首先，讓我們討論安全分析師如何使用劇本來應對 SIEM 警報，例如潛在的惡意軟體攻擊。

In this situation, a playbook is invaluable for guiding an analyst through the necessary actions to properly address the alert.
在這種情況下，劇本對於指導分析師完成必要的行動以正確應對警報非常寶貴。

The first action in the playbook is to assess the alert.
劇本中的第一個動作是評估警報。

This means determining if the alert is actually valid by identifying why the alert was generated by the SIEM.
這意味著透過識別 SIEM 產生警報的原因來確定警報是否真的有效。

This can be done by analyzing log data and related metrics.
這可以透過分析日誌數據和相關指標來完成。

Next, the playbook outlines the actions and tools to use to contain the malware and reduce further damage.
接下來，劇本概述了用於控制惡意軟體並減少進一步損害的行動和工具。

For example, this playbook instructs the analyst to isolate, or disconnect, the infected network system to prevent the malware from spreading into other parts of the network.
例如，該劇本指示分析師隔離或斷開受感染的網路系統，以防止惡意軟體擴散到網路的其他部分。

After containing the incident, step three of the playbook describes ways to eliminate all traces of the incident and restore the affected systems back to normal operations.
在控制事件後，劇本的第三步描述了消除事件所有痕跡並將受影響的系統恢復到正常運作的方法。

For example, the playbook might instruct the analyst to restore the impacted operating system, then restore the affected data using a clean backup, created before the malware outbreak.
例如，劇本可能會指示分析師還原受影響的作業系統，然後使用在惡意軟體爆發之前建立的乾淨備份來還原受影響的數據。

Finally, once the incident has been resolved, step four of the playbook instructs the analyst to perform various post-incident activities and coordination efforts with the security team.
最後，一旦事件得到解決，劇本的第四步會指示分析師執行各種事件後活動，並與安全團隊進行協調工作。

Some actions include creating a final report to communicate the security incident to stakeholders, or reporting the incident to the appropriate authorities, like the U.S.
一些行動包括建立最終報告以向利害關係人傳達安全事件，或向適當的機構報告事件，例如美國聯邦調查局或其他調查網路犯罪的機構。

Federal Bureau of Investigations or other agencies that investigate cyber crimes.
聯邦調查局或其他調查網路犯罪的機構。

This is just one example of how you might follow the steps in a playbook, since organizations develop their own internal procedures for addressing security incidents.
這只是您如何遵循劇本中步驟的一個範例，因為組織會制定自己的內部程序來應對安全事件。

What's most important to understand is that playbooks provide a consistent process for security professionals to follow.
最重要的是要理解，劇本為安全專業人員提供了一致的遵循流程。

Note that playbooks are living documents, meaning the security team will make frequent changes, updates, and improvements to address new threats and vulnerabilities.
請注意，劇本是活文件，這意味著安全團隊將經常進行變更、更新和改進，以應對新的威脅和漏洞。

In addition, organizations learn from past security incidents to improve their security posture, refine policies and procedures, and reduce the likelihood and impact of future incidents.
此外，組織會從過去的安全事件中學習，以改善其安全態勢、改進政策和程序，並減少未來事件的可能性和影響。

Then, they update their playbooks accordingly.
然後，他們會相應地更新他們的劇本。

As an entry-level security analyst, you may be required to use playbooks frequently, especially when monitoring networks and responding to incidents.
作為一名初級安全分析師，您可能需要經常使用劇本，尤其是在監控網路和回應事件時。

Having an understanding of why playbooks are important and how they can help you achieve your working objectives will help ensure your success within this field.
了解劇本為何重要以及它們如何幫助您實現工作目標將有助於確保您在這個領域取得成功。

### Erin: The importance of diversity of perspective on a security team Erin：安全團隊中觀點多樣性的重要性

Hi everyone.
大家好。

My name is Erin and I am a privacy engineer at Google.
我叫 Erin，我是 Google 的隱私工程師。

I work on speculative and emerging technology.
我從事投機性和新興技術方面的工作。

So think of things that don't exist in the world, and that are coming within the next two to five years.
所以想想世界上還不存在，但在未來兩到五年內會出現的東西。

My role is basically to take a look at all of the things that we are creating in terms of technology, and making sure that privacy is embedded in that.
我的角色基本上是檢視我們在技術方面正在創造的所有東西，並確保隱私權融入其中。

I am thinking for users before they even touch the product, making sure that when they utilize them, they'll have some form of trust in the engagement with that product.
我在使用者甚至接觸產品之前就為他們著想，確保當他們使用產品時，他們會對與該產品的互動產生某種程度的信任。

As well as knowing that we are protecting their privacy, things that they don't want to share or broadcast, and making sure that they're informed before they even touch the product.
以及了解我們正在保護他們的隱私，他們不想分享或傳播的事情，並確保他們在甚至接觸產品之前就已獲得通知。

I always talk about soft skills being the most important thing over the technical skills.
我總是說軟技能比技術技能更重要。

Because we can teach you anything but we can't teach you how to relate to people.
因為我們可以教你任何東西，但我們無法教你如何與人相處。

That is something that you bring to the table.
那是你帶來的東西。

Diversity of thought and diversity of perspectives are very useful in understanding the world that we exist in.
思想的多樣性和觀點的多樣性對於理解我們所存在的世界非常有用。

Because if we are designing products for everyday people, we need everyday people to basically help us understand those perspectives.
因為如果我們是為一般人設計產品，我們需要一般人來基本上幫助我們理解這些觀點。

Because I may look at something one way, but my colleague may see it another way based on their own experiences.
因為我可能以一種方式看待某件事，但我的同事可能會根據他們自己的經驗以另一種方式看待它。

And so, when you work together and come from different environments, you actually bring more equity and more depth to the things that you're looking at.
因此，當您一起工作並來自不同的環境時，您實際上會為您所看到的事物帶來更多的公平性和更深的深度。

And the perspective that you bring is the essential voice that is required in order to make a product better.
您帶來的觀點是使產品變得更好所必需的重要聲音。

When you look at people who work in journalism, or people who, like myself, worked in entertainment, they are bringing a different perspective for how they would tackle something.
當您看到從事新聞工作的人，或像我自己一樣，從事娛樂工作的人，他們會帶來不同的觀點來處理事情。

Or if we have a product where we are trying to convince a product team that maybe we shouldn't do this, it's always helpful to say, from someone who worked in journalism, do we really want this to end up in The Times? Probably not, right? And that is a way to come at people that, on the ground floor, they understand what that looks like.
或者，如果我們有一個產品，我們正試圖說服一個產品團隊也許我們不應該這樣做，那麼總是很有幫助地說，從一個從事新聞工作的人的角度來看，我們真的希望這件事最終出現在《紐約時報》上嗎？可能不想，對吧？這是一種接觸人們的方式，他們從基層就了解那是什麼樣子。

All of the experiences that you have had from the time you were born to now, they have been your experience.
從您出生到現在的所有經驗，都是您的經驗。

And you have to think about that in terms of where we're going with technology.
您必須從我們技術發展的方向來思考這一點。

When we're developing for a wide array of people, your experience may be someone else's experience.
當我們為廣泛的人群開發產品時，您的經驗可能是其他人的經驗。

And so if we don't have you in the room, then we are missing the opportunity to actually bring something beautiful, I would say, to the equation.
因此，如果我們沒有您在場，那麼我們就錯失了為這個等式帶來一些美好的東西的機會，我想說的是。

Which is why I encourage people, please come work with us in terms of technology.
這就是為什麼我鼓勵人們，請來和我們一起從事技術方面的工作。

Get involved in STEM because the equity across product security, privacy, you name it, whether it be software engineering, everything requires a different voice.
參與 STEM，因為產品安全、隱私等方面的公平性，無論是軟體工程，所有事情都需要不同的聲音。

And it actually requires your voice.
而且實際上需要您的聲音。

### Playbooks, SIEM tools, and SOAR tools 劇本、SIEM 工具和 SOAR 工具

Previously, you learned that security teams encounter threats, risks, vulnerabilities, and incidents on a regular basis and that they follow playbooks to address security-related issues.

Playbooks are generally used alongside SIEM tools.
劇本通常與 SIEM 工具一起使用。

If, for example, unusual user behavior is flagged by a SIEM tool, a playbook provides analysts with instructions about how to address the issue.
例如，如果 SIEM 工具標記了不尋常的使用者行為，劇本會向分析師提供有關如何解決該問題的說明。

**Playbooks and SOAR tools**
**劇本和 SOAR 工具**

Playbooks are also used with SOAR tools.
劇本也與 SOAR 工具一起使用。

SOAR tools are similar to SIEM tools in that they are used for threat monitoring.
SOAR 工具與 SIEM 工具類似，因為它們用於威脅監控。

SOAR is a piece of software used to automate repetitive tasks generated by tools such as a SIEM or managed detection and response (MDR).
SOAR 是一種軟體，用於自動化由 SIEM 或託管偵測和回應 (MDR) 等工具產生的重複性任務。

For example, if a user attempts to log into their computer too many times with the wrong password, a SOAR would automatically block their account to stop a possible intrusion.
例如，如果使用者嘗試使用錯誤的密碼多次登入其電腦，SOAR 會自動封鎖其帳戶以阻止可能的入侵。

Then, analysts would refer to a playbook to take steps to resolve the issue.
然後，分析師將參考劇本以採取措施解決該問題。

**Key takeaways**
**重點回顧**

What is most important to know is that playbooks, also sometimes referred to as runbooks, provide detailed actions for security teams to take in the event of an incident.
最重要的是要知道，劇本（有時也稱為執行手冊）提供了安全團隊在發生事件時要採取的詳細行動。

Knowing exactly who needs to do what and when can help reduce the impact of an incident and reduce the risk of damage to an organization’s critical assets.
確切地知道誰需要在何時做什麼可以幫助減少事件的影響並降低
