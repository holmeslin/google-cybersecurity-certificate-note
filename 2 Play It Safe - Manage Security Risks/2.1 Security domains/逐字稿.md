由於這些主題和相關的技術技能被認為是安全領域的核心知識，因此繼續建立您對它們的理解將有助於您減輕和管理組織每天面臨的風險和威脅。

In the next video, we'll further discuss the focus of the eight security domains introduced in the first course.
在下一個影片中，我們將進一步討論第一門課程中介紹的八個安全領域的重點。

### Explore the CISSP security domains, Part 1

Welcome back! You might remember from course one that there are eight security domains, or categories, identified by CISSP.
歡迎回來！您可能還記得在第一門課程中，CISSP 定義了八個安全領域或類別。

Security teams use them to organize daily tasks and identify gaps in security that could cause negative consequences for an organization, and to establish their security posture.
安全團隊使用它們來組織日常任務，並找出可能對組織造成負面影響的安全漏洞，並建立其安全態勢。

Security posture refers to an organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change.
安全態勢指的是組織管理其對關鍵資產和資料的防禦以及應對變化的能力。

In this video, we'll discuss the focus of the first four domains: security and risk management, asset security, security architecture and engineering, and communication and network security.
在本影片中，我們將討論前四個領域的重點：安全和風險管理、資產安全、安全架構和工程，以及通訊和網路安全。

The first domain is security and risk management.
第一個領域是安全和風險管理。

There are several areas of focus for this domain: defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations.
此領域有幾個重點領域：定義安全目標和目的、風險減輕、合規性、業務連續性和法律法規。

Let's discuss each area of focus in more detail.
讓我們更詳細地討論每個重點領域。

By defining security goals and objectives, organizations can reduce risks to critical assets and data like PII, or personally identifiable information.
透過定義安全目標和目的，組織可以降低關鍵資產和資料（例如 PII 或個人可識別資訊）的風險。

Risk mitigation means having the right procedures and rules in place to quickly reduce the impact of a risk like a breach.
風險減輕意味著制定正確的程序和規則，以快速降低漏洞等風險的影響。

Compliance is the primary method used to develop an organization's internal security policies, regulatory requirements, and independent standards.
合規性是用於制定組織內部安全策略、法規要求和獨立標準的主要方法。

Business continuity relates to an organization's ability to maintain their everyday productivity by establishing risk disaster recovery plans.
業務連續性與組織透過建立風險災害復原計畫來維持其日常生產力的能力有關。

And finally, while laws related to security and risk management are different worldwide, the overall goals are similar.
最後，雖然與安全和風險管理相關的法律在全球各地有所不同，但總體目標是相似的。

As a security professional, this means following rules and expectations for ethical behavior to minimize negligence, abuse, or fraud.
作為一名安全專業人員，這意味著遵循道德行為的規則和期望，以最大程度地減少疏忽、濫用或欺詐。

The next domain is asset security.
下一個領域是資產安全。

The asset security domain is focused on securing digital and physical assets.
資產安全領域的重點是保護數位和實體資產。

It's also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data.
它還與資料的儲存、維護、保留和銷毀有關。

This means that assets such as PII or SPII should be securely handled and protected, whether stored on a computer, transferred over a network like the internet, or even physically collected.
這意味著無論是儲存在電腦上、透過網路（例如網際網路）傳輸，甚至是實體收集的資產（例如 PII 或 SPII）都應安全地處理和保護。

Organizations also need to have policies and procedures that ensure data is properly stored, maintained, retained, and destroyed.
組織還需要制定策略和程序，以確保資料得到妥善的儲存、維護、保留和銷毀。

Knowing what data you have and who has access to it is necessary for having a strong security posture that mitigates risk to critical assets and data.
了解您擁有什麼資料以及誰有權存取這些資料，對於擁有強大的安全態勢以減輕關鍵資產和資料的風險至關重要。

Previously, we provided a few examples that touched on the disposal of data.
先前，我們提供了一些涉及資料處置的範例。

For example, an organization might have you, as a security analyst, oversee the destruction of hard drives to make sure that they're properly disposed of.
例如，組織可能會讓您（作為一名安全分析師）監督硬碟的銷毀，以確保它們得到妥善處置。

This ensures that private data stored on those drives can't be accessed by threat actors.
這可確保儲存在這些硬碟上的私人資料不會被威脅行為者存取。

The third domain is security architecture and engineering.
第三個領域是安全架構和工程。

This domain is focused on optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect an organization's assets and data.
此領域的重點是透過確保有效的工具、系統和流程到位以保護組織的資產和資料來優化資料安全。

One of the core concepts of secure design architecture is shared responsibility.
安全設計架構的核心概念之一是共同責任。

Shared responsibility means that all individuals within an organization take an active role in lowering risk and maintaining both physical and virtual security.
共同責任意味著組織內的所有個人都在降低風險和維護實體和虛擬安全方面發揮積極作用。

By having policies that encourage users to recognize and report security concerns, many issues can be handled quickly and effectively.
透過制定鼓勵使用者識別和報告安全問題的策略，許多問題可以快速有效地處理。

The fourth domain is communication and network security, which is mainly focused on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.
第四個領域是通訊和網路安全，主要重點是管理和保護實體網路和無線通訊。

Secure networks keep an organization's data and communications safe whether on-site, or in the cloud, or when connecting to services remotely.
無論是在現場、在雲端，還是在遠端連接到服務時，安全的網路都能確保組織的資料和通訊安全。

For example, employees working remotely in public spaces need to be protected from vulnerabilities that can occur when they use insecure bluetooth connections or public wifi hotspots.
例如，在公共場所遠端工作的員工需要受到保護，免受因使用不安全的藍牙連接或公共 Wi-Fi 熱點而可能發生的漏洞的影響。

By having security team members remove access to those types of communication channels at the organizational level, employees may be discouraged from practicing insecure behavior that could be exploited by threat actors.
透過讓安全團隊成員在組織層級移除對這些類型通訊管道的存取權，可以阻止員工進行可能被威脅行為者利用的不安全行為。

Now that we've reviewed the focus of our first four domains, let's discuss the last four domains.
現在我們已經回顧了前四個領域的重點，讓我們來討論後四個領域。

### Explore the CISSP security domains, Part 2

In this video, we'll cover the last four domains: identity and access management, security assessment and testing, security operations, and software development security.
在本影片中，我們將涵蓋最後四個領域：身分與存取管理、安全評估與測試、安全營運以及軟體開發安全。

The fifth domain is identity and access management, or IAM.
第五個領域是身分與存取管理，或 IAM。

And it's focused on access and authorization to keep data secure by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets.
它著重於存取和授權，透過確保使用者遵循既定策略來控制和管理資產，以保持資料安全。

As an entry-level analyst, it's essential to keep an organization's systems and data as secure as possible by ensuring user access is limited to what employees need.
作為一名初級分析師，透過確保使用者存取權僅限於員工需要的範圍，盡可能地保護組織的系統和資料至關重要。

Basically, the goal of IAM is to reduce the overall risk to systems and data.
基本上，IAM 的目標是降低系統和資料的整體風險。

For example, if everyone at a company is using the same administrator login, there is no way to track who has access to what data.
例如，如果公司中的每個人都使用相同的管理員登入資訊，則無法追蹤誰有權存取哪些資料。

In the event of a breach, separating valid user activity from the threat actor would be impossible.
一旦發生漏洞，將有效的用戶活動與威脅行為者區分開來將是不可能的。

There are four main components to IAM.
IAM 有四個主要組成部分。

Identification is when a user verifies who they are by providing a user name, an access card, or biometric data such as a fingerprint.
識別是指使用者透過提供使用者名稱、存取卡或生物特徵資料（例如指紋）來驗證其身分。

Authentication is the verification process to prove a person's identity, such as entering a password or PIN.
驗證是證明個人身分的驗證過程，例如輸入密碼或 PIN 碼。

Authorization takes place after a user's identity has been confirmed and relates to their level of access, which depends on the role in the organization.
授權在使用者身分驗證後進行，並且與他們的存取權限級別有關，這取決於在組織中的角色。

Accountability refers to monitoring and recording user actions, like login attempts, to prove systems and data are used properly.
問責性是指監控和記錄使用者操作（例如登入嘗試），以證明系統和資料得到正確使用。

The sixth security domain is security assessment and testing.
第六個安全領域是安全評估與測試。

This domain focuses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
此領域著重於進行安全控制測試、收集和分析資料，以及進行安全稽核以監控風險、威脅和漏洞。

Security control testing can help an organization identify new and better ways to mitigate threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
安全控制測試可以幫助組織找到減輕威脅、風險和漏洞的新的和更好的方法。

This involves examining organizational goals and objectives, and evaluating if the controls being used actually achieve those goals.
這包括檢查組織的目標和目的，並評估正在使用的控制是否真正實現了這些目標。

Collecting and analyzing security data regularly also helps prevent threats and risks to the organization.
定期收集和分析安全資料也有助於預防組織的威脅和風險。

Analysts might use security control testing evaluations and security assessment reports to improve existing controls or implement new controls.
分析師可能會使用安全控制測試評估和安全評估報告來改進現有控制或實施新控制。

An example of implementing a new control could be requiring the use of multi-factor authentication to better protect the organization from potential threats and risks.
實施新控制的一個範例可能是要求使用多因素驗證，以更好地保護組織免受潛在威脅和風險的侵害。

Next, let's discuss security operations.
接下來，讓我們討論安全營運。

The security operations domain is focused on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.
安全營運領域著重於進行調查和實施預防措施。

Investigations begin once a security incident has been identified.
一旦發現安全事件，調查就會開始。

This process requires a heightened sense of urgency in order to minimize potential risks to the organization.
此過程需要高度的緊迫感，以最大程度地減少對組織的潛在風險。

If there is an active attack, mitigating the attack and preventing it from escalating further is essential for ensuring that private information is protected from threat actors.
如果發生主動攻擊，減輕攻擊並防止其進一步升級對於確保私人資訊免受威脅行為者的侵害至關重要。

Once the threat has been neutralized, the collection of digital and physical evidence to conduct a forensic investigation will begin.
一旦威脅被消除，就會開始收集數位和實體證據以進行鑑識調查。

A digital forensic investigation must take place to identify when, how, and why the breach occurred.
必須進行數位鑑識調查，以查明漏洞發生的時間、方式和原因。

This helps security teams determine areas for improvement and preventative measures that can be taken to mitigate future attacks.
這有助於安全團隊確定需要改進的領域以及可以採取哪些預防措施來減輕未來的攻擊。

The eighth and final security domain is software development security.
第八個也是最後一個安全領域是軟體開發安全。

This domain focuses on using secure coding practices.
此領域著重於使用安全程式碼編寫實務。

As you may remember, secure coding practices are recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.
您可能還記得，安全程式碼編寫實務是用於建立安全應用程式和服務的建議準則。

The software development lifecycle is an efficient process used by teams to quickly build software products and features.
軟體開發生命週期是團隊用來快速構建軟體產品和功能的高效流程。

In this process, security is an additional step.
在此過程中，安全性是一個額外的步驟。

By ensuring that each phase of the software development lifecycle undergoes security reviews, security can be fully integrated into the software product.
透過確保軟體開發生命週期的每個階段都經過安全審查，可以將安全性完全整合到軟體產品中。

For example, performing a secure design review during the design phase, secure code reviews during the development and testing phases, and penetration testing during the deployment and implementation phase ensures that security is embedded into the software product at every step.
例如，在設計階段執行安全設計審查，在開發和測試階段執行安全程式碼審查，以及在部署和實施階段執行滲透測試，可確保安全性在每個步驟都嵌入到軟體產品中。

This keeps software secure and sensitive data protected, and mitigates unnecessary risk to an organization.
這可以保持軟體安全和敏感資料受到保護，並減輕組織不必要的風險。

Being familiar with these domains can help you better understand how they're used to improve the overall security of an organization and the critical role security teams play.
熟悉這些領域可以幫助您更好地了解它們如何用於提高組織的整體安全性以及安全團隊所扮演的關鍵角色。

Next, we'll discuss security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities, including ransomware, and introduce you to the three layers of the web.
接下來，我們將討論安全威脅、風險和漏洞，包括勒索軟體，並向您介紹網路的三個層次。

舉例來說，安全團隊可能需要改變處理個人可識別資訊 (PII) 的方式，以遵守歐盟的《通用資料保護規則》(GDPR)。

**Domain two: Asset security**
**領域二：資產安全**

Asset security involves managing the cybersecurity processes of organizational assets, including the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of physical and virtual data.
資產安全涉及管理組織資產的網路安全流程，包括實體和虛擬資料的儲存、維護、保留和銷毀。

Because the loss or theft of assets can expose an organization and increase the level of risk, keeping track of assets and the data they hold is essential.
由於資產的遺失或被盜可能會使組織暴露並增加風險程度，因此追蹤資產及其包含的資料至關重要。

Conducting a security impact analysis, establishing a recovery plan, and managing data exposure will depend on the level of risk associated with each asset.
進行安全影響分析、建立復原計畫和管理資料暴露將取決於與每個資產相關的風險程度。

Security analysts may need to store, maintain, and retain data by creating backups to ensure they are able to restore the environment if a security incident places the organization’s data at risk.
安全分析師可能需要透過建立備份來儲存、維護和保留資料，以確保他們能夠在安全事件使組織的資料面臨風險時還原環境。

**Domain three: Security architecture and engineering**
領域三：安全架構與工程

This domain focuses on managing data security.
此領域著重於管理資料安全。

Ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place helps protect an organization’s assets and data.
確保有效的工具、系統和流程到位有助於保護組織的資產和資料。

Security architects and engineers create these processes.
安全架構師和工程師會建立這些流程。

One important aspect of this domain is the concept of shared responsibility.
此領域的一個重要方面是共同責任的概念。

Shared responsibility means all individuals involved take an active role in lowering risk during the design of a security system.
共同責任意味著所有相關人員在安全系統的設計過程中都應積極參與降低風險。

Additional design principles related to this domain, which are discussed later in the program, include:

    縱深防禦
-   Fail securely
    安全失敗
-   Separation of duties
    職責分離
-   Keep it simple
    保持簡單
-   Zero trust
    零信任
-   Trust but verify
    信任但驗證

An example of managing data is the use of a security information and event management (SIEM) tool to monitor for flags related to unusual login or user activity that could indicate a threat actor is attempting to access private data.
管理資料的一個範例是使用安全資訊和事件管理 (SIEM) 工具來監控與異常登入或使用者活動相關的標記，這些標記可能表明威脅行為者正試圖存取私人資料。

**Domain four: Communication and network security**
**領域四：通訊和網路安全**
This domain focuses on managing and securing physical networks and wireless communications.
此領域著重於管理和保護實體網路和無線通訊。

This includes on-site, remote, and cloud communications.
這包括現場、遠端和雲端通訊。

Organizations with remote, hybrid, and on-site work environments must ensure data remains secure, but managing external connections to make certain that remote workers are securely accessing an organization’s networks is a challenge.
擁有遠端、混合和現場工作環境的組織必須確保資料保持安全，但管理外部連線以確保遠端工作人員安全地存取組織的網路是一項挑戰。

Designing network security controls—such as restricted network access—can help protect users and ensure an organization’s network remains secure when employees travel or work outside of the main office.
設計網路安全控制（例如受限的網路存取）可以幫助保護使用者，並確保當員工出差或在主要辦公室外工作時，組織的網路保持安全。

**Domain five: Identity and access management**

**領域五：身分與存取管理**

The identity and access management (IAM) domain focuses on keeping data secure.
身分與存取管理 (IAM) 領域著重於保持資料安全。

It does this by ensuring user identities are trusted and authenticated and that access to physical and logical assets is authorized.
它透過確保使用者身分受到信任和驗證，以及對實體和邏輯資產的存取獲得授權來實現這一點。

This helps prevent unauthorized users, while allowing authorized users to perform their tasks.
這有助於阻止未經授權的使用者，同時允許授權使用者執行其任務。

Essentially, IAM uses what is referred to as the principle of least privilege, which is the concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task.
基本上，IAM 使用所謂的最小權限原則，即僅授予完成任務所需的最小存取權和授權的概念。

As an example, a cybersecurity analyst might be asked to ensure that customer service representatives can only view the private data of a customer, such as their phone number, while working to resolve the customer's issue; then remove access when the customer's issue is resolved.
舉例來說，網路安全分析師可能會被要求確保客服代表在努力解決客戶問題時只能查看客戶的私人資料，例如他們的電話號碼；然後在客戶問題解決後撤銷存取權。

**Domain six: Security assessment and testing**

**領域六：安全評估與測試**

The security assessment and testing domain focuses on identifying and mitigating risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
安全評估和測試領域著重於識別和減輕風險、威脅和漏洞。

Security assessments help organizations determine whether their internal systems are secure or at risk.
安全評估幫助組織確定其內部系統是安全的還是處於危險之中。

Organizations might employ penetration testers, often referred to as “pen testers,” to find vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a threat actor.
組織可能會聘請滲透測試人員，通常稱為「筆測試人員」，以尋找可能被威脅行為者利用的漏洞。

This domain suggests that organizations conduct security control testing, as well as collect and analyze data.
此領域建議組織進行安全控制測試，以及收集和分析資料。

Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of conducting security audits to monitor for and reduce the probability of a data breach.
此外，它強調進行安全稽核以監控並降低資料外洩機率的重要性。

To contribute to these types of tasks, cybersecurity professionals may be tasked with auditing user permissions to validate that users have the correct levels of access to internal systems.
為了協助執行這些類型的任務，網路安全專業人員可能會被指派稽核使用者權限，以驗證使用者是否擁有對內部系統的正確存取權限級別。

**Domain seven: Security operations**

**領域七：安全營運**

The security operations domain focuses on the investigation of a potential data breach and the implementation of preventative measures after a security incident has occurred.
安全營運領域著重於調查潛在的資料外洩，以及在安全事件發生後實施預防措施。

Security must be incorporated into each element of the software development life cycle, from design and development to testing and release.
必須將安全性納入軟體開發生命週期的每個要素，從設計和開發到測試和發佈。

To achieve security, the software development process must have security in mind at each step.
為了實現安全性，軟體開發過程的每個步驟都必須考慮到安全性。

Security cannot be an afterthought.
安全性絕不能是事後才考慮的事情。

Performing application security tests can help ensure vulnerabilities are identified and mitigated accordingly.
執行應用程式安全測試有助於確保識別並相應地減輕漏洞。

Having a system in place to test the programming conventions, software executables, and security measures embedded in the software is necessary.
建立一個系統來測試程式設計慣例、軟體可執行檔和嵌入在軟體中的安全措施是必要的。

Having quality assurance and pen tester professionals ensure the software has met security and performance standards is also an essential part of the software development process.
讓品質保證和筆測試專業人員確保軟體符合安全和效能標準也是軟體開發過程中不可或缺的一部分。

For example, an entry-level analyst working for a pharmaceutical company might be asked to make sure encryption is properly configured for a new medical device that will store private patient data.
例如，在製藥公司工作的初級分析師可能會被要求確保為將儲存私人病患資料的新醫療裝置正確配置加密。

I was with that company for almost five years before I came to Google.
在來 Google 之前，我在那家公司待了將近五年。

If you're new and you're just coming in, you have to know how to work with a team.
如果你是新手並且剛加入這個行業，你必須知道如何與團隊合作。

I think a lot of us learned that in customer service settings.
我認為我們很多人都是在客戶服務環境中學到這一點的。

Some of the skills I learned working in retail, dealing with hard customers, learning how to even talk to people or diffuse a situation if people are upset about things, just learning how to talk to people.
我在零售業工作時學到的一些技能，包括應付難纏的顧客，學習如何與人交談，甚至在人們對某些事情感到不安時如何化解局面，只是學習如何與人交談。

In IT we need that.
在資訊科技業，我們需要這種能力。

It's no longer just the tech skills we need, the more T-shaped which they're soft skills, there's people skills, and there's technical skills.
我們不再只需要技術技能，更需要 T 型人才，他們擁有軟技能、人際交往能力和技術技能。

You have to have good analysis skills, and again, it doesn't even have to be technical analysis, if you can read a book and pick apart the rhetorical devices of that story, you can do analysis work.
你必須具備良好的分析能力，而且同樣地，它甚至不一定是技術分析，如果你能讀一本書並挑出故事中的修辭手法，你就能做分析工作。

I didn't have to be a software engineer to work in this field.
我不需要成為一名軟體工程師才能在這個領域工作。

For many of us, there's like a math fear, programming is a big hurdle, but we work with people, we work with processes, and you don't necessarily need to have that coding knowledge to understand people or processes.
對於我們許多人來說，存在著一種對數學的恐懼，程式設計是一個很大的障礙，但我們與人合作，我們與流程合作，你並不一定需要具備程式碼編寫知識才能理解人或流程。

There's so many ways to break in, so do not get discouraged and don't be scared to think outside of the box to get your foot in the door.
有很多種方法可以進入這個行業，所以不要氣餒，不要害怕跳脫框架思考，以求踏入這個行業。

### Threats, risks, and vulnerabilities

As an entry-level security analyst, one of your many roles will be to handle an organization's digital and physical assets.
作為一名初級安全分析師，您的眾多角色之一將是處理組織的數位和實體資產。

As a reminder, an asset is an item perceived as having value to an organization.
提醒一下，資產是指被認為對組織有價值的項目。

During their lifespan, organizations acquire all types of assets, including physical office spaces, computers, customers' PII, intellectual property, such as patents or copyrighted data, and so much more.
在它們的生命週期中，組織會獲得各種類型的資產，包括實體辦公空間、電腦、客戶的 PII、智慧財產權（例如專利或受版權保護的資料）等等。

Unfortunately, organizations operate in an environment that presents multiple security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities to their assets.
不幸的是，組織在一個會對其資產構成多重安全威脅、風險和漏洞的環境中運作。

Let's review what threats, risks, and vulnerabilities are and discuss some common examples of each.
讓我們回顧一下威脅、風險和漏洞是什麼，並討論每個的一些常見範例。

A threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
威脅是任何可能對資產產生負面影響的情況或事件。

One example of a threat is a social engineering attack.
威脅的一個範例是社交工程攻擊。

Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
社交工程是一種操縱技巧，它利用人為錯誤來獲取私人資訊、存取權或貴重物品。

Malicious links in email messages that look like they're from legitimate companies or people is one method of social engineering known as phishing.
電子郵件訊息中看起來像是來自合法公司或人員的惡意連結是一種稱為網路釣魚的社交工程方法。

As a reminder, phishing is a technique that is used to acquire sensitive data, such as user names, passwords, or banking information.
提醒一下，網路釣魚是一種用於獲取敏感資料（例如使用者名稱、密碼或銀行資訊）的技術。

Risks are different from threats.
風險與威脅不同。

A risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.
風險是任何可能影響資產的機密性、完整性或可用性的事物。

Think of a risk as the likelihood of a threat occurring.
將風險視為威脅發生的可能性。

An example of a risk to an organization might be the lack of backup protocols for making sure its stored information can be recovered in the event of an accident or security incident.
組織面臨的一個風險範例可能是缺乏備份協定，以確保其儲存的資訊在發生意外或安全事件時可以恢復。

Organizations tend to rate risks at different levels: low, medium, and high, depending on possible threats and the value of an asset.
組織傾向於根據可能的威脅和資產的價值，將風險評級為不同級別：低、中和高。

A low-risk asset is information that would not harm the organization's reputation or ongoing operations, and would not cause financial damage if compromised.
低風險資產是指如果洩露不會損害組織聲譽或持續營運，也不會造成財務損失的資訊。

This includes public information such as website content, or published research data.
這包括公開資訊，例如網站內容或已發佈的研究數據。

A medium-risk asset might include information that's not available to the public and may cause some damage to the organization's finances, reputation, or ongoing operations.
中等風險資產可能包括無法公開取得的資訊，並且可能對組織的財務、聲譽或持續營運造成一些損害。

For example, the early release of a company's quarterly earnings could impact the value of their stock.
例如，公司季度收益的提前發布可能會影響其股票的價值。

A high-risk asset is any information protected by regulations or laws, which if compromised, would have a severe negative impact on an organization's finances, ongoing operations, or reputation.
高風險資產是任何受法規或法律保護的資訊，如果洩露，將對組織的財務、持續營運或聲譽產生嚴重的負面影響。

This could include leaked assets with SPII, PII, or intellectual property.
這可能包括洩露的包含 SPII、PII 或智慧財產權的資產。

Now, let's discuss vulnerabilities.
現在，讓我們討論漏洞。

A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat.
漏洞是可能被威脅利用的弱點。

And it's worth noting that both a vulnerability and threat must be present for there to be a risk.
值得注意的是，必須同時存在漏洞和威脅才會構成風險。

Examples of vulnerabilities include: an outdated firewall, software, or application; weak passwords; or unprotected confidential data.
漏洞的範例包括：過時的防火牆、軟體或應用程式；弱密碼；或未受保護的機密資料。

People can also be considered a vulnerability.
人也可能被視為一種漏洞。

People's actions can significantly affect an organization's internal network.
人們的行為會嚴重影響組織的內部網路。

Whether it's a client, external vendor, or employee, maintaining security must be a united effort.
無論是客戶、外部供應商還是員工，維護安全都必須是共同的努力。

So entry-level analysts need to educate and empower people to be more security conscious.
因此，初級分析師需要教育並賦予人們權力，使其更具安全意識。

For example, educating people on how to identify a phishing email is a great starting point.
例如，教育人們如何識別網路釣魚電子郵件是一個很好的起點。

Using access cards to grant employee access to physical spaces while restricting outside visitors is another good security measure.
使用存取卡授予員工進入實體空間的權限，同時限制外部訪客是另一項良好的安全措施。

Organizations must continually improve their efforts when it comes to identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities to minimize threats and risks.
組織在識別和減輕漏洞以最大程度地減少威脅和風險方面必須不斷改進其工作。

Entry-level analysts can support this goal by encouraging employees to report suspicious activity and actively monitoring and documenting employees' access to critical assets.
初級分析師可以透過鼓勵員工報告可疑活動，並主動監控和記錄員工對關鍵資產的存取來支持此目標。

Now that you're familiar with some of the threats, risks, and vulnerabilities analysts frequently encounter, coming up, we'll discuss how they impact business operations.
既然您已經熟悉了分析師經常遇到的一些威脅、風險和漏洞，接下來，我們將討論它們如何影響企業營運。

### Key impacts of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities 威脅、風險和漏洞的主要影響

In this video, we'll discuss an expensive type of malware called ransomware.
在本影片中，我們將討論一種稱為勒索軟體的昂貴惡意軟體。

Then we'll cover three key impacts of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities on organizational operations.
然後，我們將介紹威脅、風險和漏洞對組織營運的三個主要影響。

Ransomware is a malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data then demand payment to restore access.
勒索軟體是一種惡意攻擊，威脅行為者會加密組織的資料，然後要求付款以恢復存取權。

Once ransomware is deployed by an attacker, it can freeze network systems, leave devices unusable, and encrypt, or lock confidential data, making devices inaccessible.
一旦攻擊者部署勒索軟體，它就會凍結網路系統、使裝置無法使用，並加密或鎖定機密資料，使裝置無法存取。

The threat actor then demands a ransom before providing a decryption key to allow organizations to return to their normal business operations.
然後，威脅行為者會要求支付贖金，然後才提供解密金鑰，以允許組織恢復正常的業務營運。

Think of a decryption key as a password provided to regain access to your data.
將解密金鑰視為用於重新獲得資料存取權的密碼。

Note that when ransom negotiations occur or data is leaked by threat actors, these events can occur through the dark web.
請注意，當發生贖金談判或威脅行為者洩露資料時，這些事件可能會透過暗網發生。

While many people use search engines to navigate to their social media accounts or to shop online, this is only a small part of what the web really is.
雖然許多人使用搜尋引擎來瀏覽他們的社群媒體帳戶或在網路上購物，但這只是網路真實面貌的一小部分。

The web is actually an interlinked network of online content that's made up of three layers: the surface web, the deep web, and the dark web.
網路實際上是由三個層次組成的互連線上內容網路：表層網路、深層網路和暗網。

The surface web is the layer that most people use.
表層網路是大多數人使用的層次。

It contains content that can be accessed using a web browser.
它包含可以使用網路瀏覽器存取的內容。

The deep web generally requires authorization to access it.
深層網路通常需要授權才能存取。

An organization's intranet is an example of the deep web, since it can only be accessed by employees or others who have been granted access.
組織的內部網路是深層網路的一個範例，因為它只能由員工或其他已獲得授權的人員存取。

Lastly, the dark web can only be accessed by using special software.
最後，暗網只能使用特殊軟體存取。

The dark web generally carries a negative connotation since it is the preferred web layer for criminals because of the secrecy that it provides.
暗網通常帶有負面含義，因為它是犯罪分子首選的網路層，因為它提供了隱密性。

Now, let's discuss three key impacts of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
現在，讓我們討論威脅、風險和漏洞的三個主要影響。

The first impact we'll discuss is financial impact.
我們將討論的第一個影響是財務影響。

When an organization's assets are compromised by an attack, such as the use of malware, the financial consequences can be significant for a variety of reasons.
當組織的資產受到攻擊（例如使用惡意軟體）的損害時，由於各種原因，財務後果可能非常嚴重。

These can include interrupted production and services, the cost to correct the issue, and fines if assets are compromised because of non-compliance with laws and regulations.
這些可能包括生產和服務中斷、糾正問題的成本，以及如果由於不遵守法律和法規而導致資產受損的罰款。

The second impact is identity theft.
第二個影響是身分盜用。

Organizations must decide whether to store private customer, employee, and outside vendor data, and for how long.
組織必須決定是否儲存私人客戶、員工和外部供應商資料，以及儲存多長時間。

Storing any type of sensitive data presents a risk to the organization.
儲存任何類型的敏感資料都會對組織構成風險。

Sensitive data can include personally identifiable information, or PII, which can be sold or leaked through the dark web.
敏感資料可能包括個人可識別資訊 (PII)，這些資訊可能會透過暗網出售或洩露。

That's because the dark web provides a sense of secrecy and threat actors may have the ability to sell data there without facing legal consequences.
這是因為暗網提供了一種隱密感，威脅行為者可能有能力在那裡出售資料而不會面臨法律後果。

The last impact we'll discuss is damage to an organization's reputation.
我們將討論的最後一個影響是損害組織的聲譽。

A solid customer base supports an organization's mission, vision, and financial goals.
穩固的客戶群支持組織的使命、願景和財務目標。

An exploited vulnerability can lead customers to seek new business relationships with competitors or create bad press that causes permanent damage to an organization's reputation.
被利用的漏洞可能導致客戶尋求與競爭對手建立新的業務關係，或產生對組織聲譽造成永久損害的負面新聞。

The loss of customer data doesn't only affect an organization's reputation and financials, it may also result in legal penalties and fines.
客戶資料的遺失不僅會影響組織的聲譽和財務狀況，還可能導致法律處罰和罰款。

Organizations are strongly encouraged to take proper security measures and follow certain protocols to prevent the significant impact of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
強烈建議組織採取適當的安全措施並遵循某些協定，以防止威脅、風險和漏洞的重大影響。

By using all the tools in their toolkit, security teams are better prepared to handle an event such as a ransomware attack.
透過使用其工具包中的所有工具，安全團隊可以更好地應對勒索軟體攻擊等事件。

Coming up, we'll cover the NIST risk management framework's seven steps for managing risk.
接下來，我們將介紹 NIST 風險管理框架的七個風險管理步驟。

### Herbert: Manage threats, risks, and vulnerabilities Herbert：管理威脅、風險和漏洞

My name is Herbert and I am a Security Engineer at Google.
我叫 Herbert，我是 Google 的一名安全工程師。

I think I've always been interested in security, in high school our school gave us these huge Dell laptops.
我認為我一直對安全感興趣，高中時，我們學校給了我們這些巨大的 Dell 筆記型電腦。

There wasn't a whole lot of security within those computers.
這些電腦的安全性並不好。

So, many of my friends would have cracked versions of like video games like Halo, that's really where I learned how to start manipulating computers to kind of do what I want.
所以，我的許多朋友都有像《最後一戰》這樣的破解版電玩遊戲，這真的是我學習如何開始操縱電腦來做我想做的事情的地方。

I guess [LAUGH] my day to day consists of analyzing security risks and providing solutions to those risks.
我想 [笑] 我的日常工作包括分析安全風險並為這些風險提供解決方案。

A typical task for cybersecurity analysts would usually be something like exceptions requests.
網路安全分析師的典型任務通常是處理例外請求之類的事情。

Analyzing if someone needs to have special access to a device or document based on the role that the person has or the project that they're working on.
根據該人員的角色或他們正在進行的專案，分析某人是否需要對裝置或文件具有特殊存取權。

One of the more common threats that we come across is misconfigurations or requesting access for something that you don't really need.
我們遇到的較常見的威脅之一是錯誤配置或請求不需要的東西的存取權。

For example, I recently had a case where a vendor we were working with had changed their OAuth scope requests.
例如，我最近遇到一個案例，我們合作的供應商更改了他們的 OAuth 範圍請求。

And basically that means that they were requesting more permissions to use Google services than they had before in the past.
基本上，這意味著他們請求比過去更多的權限來使用 Google 服務。

We weren't sure really how to go about that because that wasn't a situation we've come across before.
我們不太確定該如何處理，因為這不是我們以前遇到過的情況。

So it's still ongoing, but we're working with partner teams to kind of develop a solution for that.
所以它仍在進行中，但我們正與合作夥伴團隊合作，以針對此問題開發解決方案。

I think another thing that we've seen is outdated systems, machines that need to be patched.
我認為我們看到的另一件事是過時的系統，需要修補的機器。

That sounds like an IT issue, but it's also definitely a cybersecurity issue.
這聽起來像是個資訊科技問題，但它絕對也是一個網路安全問題。

Having outdated machines, not having proper device management policies, working with a team or many teams is a huge part of the job.
擁有過時的機器、沒有適當的裝置管理策略，與一個或多個團隊合作是這項工作的重要組成部分。

In order to get really anything done, you need to communicate with not just the team that you're a part of, but with other teams.
為了真正完成任何事情，您不僅需要與您所屬的團隊溝通，還需要與其他團隊溝通。

Ten years ago I was working at a pizza joint and ten years later, here I am, at Google as a Security Engineer.
十年前我在一家披薩店工作，十年後，我卻在 Google 擔任安全工程師。

If I told my 16 year old self that I would be here, I wouldn't have believed myself, but it is possible.
如果我告訴 16 歲的自己我會在這裡，我不會相信自己，但這是可能的。

### NIST’s Risk Management Framework

NIST 的風險管理框架

As you might remember from earlier in the program, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST, provides many frameworks that are used by security professionals to manage risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
您可能還記得在本課程稍早的部分，美國國家標準與技術研究院 (NIST) 提供了許多框架，供安全專業人員用來管理風險、威脅和漏洞。

In this video, we're going to focus on NIST's Risk Management Framework or RMF.
在本影片中，我們將重點介紹 NIST 的風險管理框架或 RMF。

As an entry-level analyst, you may not engage in all of these steps, but it's important to be familiar with this framework.
作為一名初級分析師，您可能不會參與所有這些步驟，但熟悉此框架非常重要。

Having a solid foundational understanding of how to mitigate and manage risks can set yourself apart from other candidates as you begin your job search in the field of security.
在您開始在安全領域尋找工作時，對如何減輕和管理風險有紮實的基礎理解可以使您從其他候選人中脫穎而出。

There are seven steps in the RMF: prepare, categorize, select, implement, assess, authorize, and monitor.
RMF 有七個步驟：準備、分類、選擇、實施、評估、授權和監控。

Let's start with Step one, prepare.
讓我們從第一步「準備」開始。

Prepare refers to activities that are necessary to manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs.
準備是指在發生漏洞之前管理安全和隱私風險所需的活動。

As an entry-level analyst, you'll likely use this step to monitor for risks and identify controls that can be used to reduce those risks.
作為一名初級分析師，您可能會使用此步驟來監控風險並識別可用於降低這些風險的控制措施。

Step two is categorize, which is used to develop risk management processes and tasks.
第二步是「分類」，用於制定風險管理流程和任務。

Security professionals then use those processes and develop tasks by thinking about how the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of systems and information can be impacted by risk.
然後，安全專業人員會使用這些流程並透過思考系統和資訊的機密性、完整性和可用性如何受到風險的影響來制定任務。

As an entry-level analyst, you'll need to be able to understand how to follow the processes established by your organization to reduce risks to critical assets, such as private customer information.
作為一名初級分析師，您需要能夠理解如何遵循您的組織建立的流程，以降低關鍵資產（例如私人客戶資訊）的風險。

Step three is select.
第三步是「選擇」。

Select means to choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization.
選擇是指選擇、自訂和捕獲保護組織的控制措施的文件記錄。

An example of the select step would be keeping a playbook up-to-date or helping to manage other documentation that allows you and your team to address issues more efficiently.
「選擇」步驟的一個範例是保持劇本的最新狀態，或協助管理其他文件記錄，使您和您的團隊能夠更有效地解決問題。

Step four is to implement security and privacy plans for the organization.
第四步是為組織「實施」安全和隱私計畫。

Having good plans in place is essential for minimizing the impact of ongoing security risks.
制定良好的計畫對於最大程度地減少持續安全風險的影響至關重要。

For example, if you notice a pattern of employees constantly needing password resets, implementing a change to password requirements may help solve this issue.
例如，如果您發現員工不斷需要重設密碼的模式，則變更密碼要求可能有助於解決此問題。

Step five is assess.
第五步是「評估」。

Assess means to determine if established controls are implemented correctly.
評估是指確定已建立的控制措施是否已正確實施。

An organization always wants to operate as efficiently as possible.
組織始終希望盡可能高效地運作。

So it's essential to take the time to analyze whether the implemented protocols, procedures, and controls that are in place are meeting organizational needs.
因此，務必花時間分析已實施的協定、程序和控制措施是否滿足組織需求。

During this step, analysts identify potential weaknesses and determine whether the organization's tools, procedures, controls, and protocols should be changed to better manage potential risks.
在此步驟中，分析師會識別潛在的弱點，並確定是否應變更組織的工具、程序、控制措施和協定，以更好地管理潛在風險。

Step six is authorize.
第六步是「授權」。

Authorize means being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization.
授權是指對組織中可能存在的安全和隱私風險負責。

As an analyst, the authorization step could involve generating reports, developing plans of action, and establishing project milestones that are aligned to your organization's security goals.
作為一名分析師，「授權」步驟可能包括產生報告、制定行動計畫以及建立與組織安全目標一致的專案里程碑。

Step seven is monitor.
第七步是「監控」。

Monitor means to be aware of how systems are operating.
監控是指了解系統的運作方式。

Assessing and maintaining technical operations are tasks that analysts complete daily.
評估和維護技術營運是分析師每天完成的任務。

Part of maintaining a low level of risk for an organization is knowing how the current systems support the organization's security goals.
維護組織的低風險等級的一部分是了解目前的系統如何支持組織的安全目標。

If the systems in place don't meet those goals, changes may be needed.
如果現有的系統未能達到這些目標，則可能需要進行變更。

Although it may not be your job to establish these procedures, you will need to make sure they're working as intended so that risks to the organization itself, and the people it serves, are minimized.
雖然建立這些程序可能不是您的工作，但您需要確保它們按預期運作，以最大程度地減少組織本身及其服務對象的風險。

### Manage common threats, risks, and vulnerabilities 管理常見的威脅、風險和漏洞

Previously, you learned that security involves protecting organizations and people from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
先前，您了解到安全涉及保護組織和人員免受威脅、風險和漏洞的侵害。

Understanding the current threat landscapes gives organizations the ability to create policies and processes designed to help prevent and mitigate these types of security issues.
了解當前的威脅態勢使組織能夠制定旨在幫助預防和減輕此類安全問題的策略和流程。

In this reading, you will further explore how to manage risk and some common threat actor tactics and techniques, so you are better prepared to protect organizations and the people they serve when you enter the cybersecurity field.
在本篇閱讀中，您將進一步探索如何管理風險以及一些常見的威脅行為者策略和技術，以便在您進入網路安全領域時，能更好地保護組織及其服務對象。

**Risk management**
**風險管理**

A primary goal of organizations is to protect assets.
組織的主要目標是保護資產。

An asset is an item perceived as having value to an organization.
資產是指被認為對組織有價值的項目。

Assets can be digital or physical.
資產可以是數位或實體的。

Examples of digital assets include the personal information of employees, clients, or vendors, such as:
數位資產的範例包括員工、客戶或供應商的個人資訊，例如：

-   Social Security Numbers (SSNs), or unique national identification numbers assigned to individuals
    社會安全號碼 (SSN)，或分配給個人的唯一國家身分證號碼
-   Dates of birth
    出生日期
-   Bank account numbers
    銀行帳號
-   Mailing addresses
    郵寄地址
    Examples of physical assets include: 實體資產的範例包括：
-   Payment kiosks
    支付資訊站
-   Servers
    伺服器
-   Desktop computers
    桌上型電腦
-   Office spaces
    辦公空間

Some common strategies used to manage risks include:
用於管理風險的一些常見策略包括：

-   Acceptance: Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity
    接受：接受風險以避免中斷業務連續性
-   Avoidance: Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether
    避免：制定計畫以完全避免風險
-   Transference: Transferring risk to a third party to manage
    轉移：將風險轉移給第三方管理
-   Mitigation: Lessening the impact of a known risk
    減輕：減輕已知風險的影響

Additionally, organizations implement risk management processes based on widely accepted frameworks to help protect digital and physical assets from various threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
此外，組織根據廣泛接受的框架實施風險管理流程，以幫助保護數位和實體資產免受各種威脅、風險和漏洞的侵害。

Examples of frameworks commonly used in the cybersecurity industry include the National Institute of Standards and Technology Risk Management Framework (NIST RMF) and Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST).
網路安全產業中常用的框架範例包括美國國家標準與技術研究院風險管理框架 (NIST RMF) 和健康資訊信任聯盟 (HITRUST)。

Following are some common types of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities you’ll help organizations manage as a security professional.
以下是您將作為安全專業人員幫助組織管理的一些常見威脅、風險和漏洞類型。

**Today’s most common threats, risks, and vulnerabilities**
**當今最常見的威脅、風險和漏洞**

**Threats**
**威脅**

A threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets.
威脅是任何可能對資產產生負面影響的情況或事件。

As an entry-level security analyst, your job is to help defend the organization’s assets from inside and outside threats.
作為一名初級安全分析師，您的工作是幫助保護組織的資產免受內外部威脅。

Therefore, understanding common types of threats is important to an analyst’s daily work.
因此，了解常見的威脅類型對於分析師的日常工作非常重要。

As a reminder, common threats include:
提醒一下，常見的威脅包括：

-   Insider threats: Staff members or vendors abuse their authorized access to obtain data that may harm an organization.
    內部威脅：員工或供應商濫用其授權存取權以獲取可能損害組織的資料。
-   Advanced persistent threats (APTs): A threat actor maintains unauthorized access to a system for an extended period of time.
    進階持續性威脅 (APT)：威脅行為者在很長一段時間內保持對系統的未經授權存取。

**Risks**

**風險**

A risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset.
風險是任何可能影響資產的機密性、完整性或可用性的事物。

A basic formula for determining the level of risk is that risk equals the likelihood of a threat.
用於確定風險等級的一個基本公式是：風險等於威脅發生的可能性。

One way to think about this is that a risk is being late to work and threats are traffic, an accident, a flat tire, etc.
一種思考方式是，風險是上班遲到，而威脅是交通、事故、輪胎爆胎等等。

There are different factors that can affect the likelihood of a risk to an organization’s assets, including:
有許多因素會影響組織資產面臨風險的可能性，包括：

-   External risk: Anything outside the organization that has the potential to harm organizational assets, such as threat actors attempting to gain access to private information
-   外部風險：組織外部任何可能損害組織資產的事物，例如威脅行為者試圖存取私人資訊
-   Internal risk: A current or former employee, vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk
-   內部風險：構成安全風險的現任或前任員工、供應商或受信任的合作夥伴
-   Legacy systems: Old systems that might not be accounted for or updated, but can still impact assets, such as workstations or old mainframe systems.
    For example, an organization might have an old vending - machine that takes credit card payments or a workstation that is still connected to the legacy accounting system.
-   舊系統：可能未被考慮或更新的舊系統，但仍然會影響資產，例如工作站或舊的主機系統。例如，組織可能有一台接受信用卡付款的舊自動販賣機，或一台仍連接到舊會計系統的工作站。
-   Multiparty risk: Outsourcing work to third-party vendors can give them access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets, software designs, and inventions.
-   多方風險：將工作外包給第三方供應商可能會讓他們存取智慧財產權，例如商業機密、軟體設計和發明。
-   Software compliance/licensing: Software that is not updated or in compliance, or patches that are not installed in a timely manner
-   軟體合規性/授權：未更新或不合規的軟體，或未及時安裝的修補程式

There are many resources, such as the NIST, that provide lists of "cybersecurity risks".
有許多資源，例如 NIST，提供了「網路安全風險」的列表。

Additionally, the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) publishes a standard awareness document about the "top 10 most critical security risks" to web applications, which is updated regularly.
此外，開放網路應用程式安全專案 (OWASP) 發布了一份關於網路應用程式「十大最關鍵安全風險」的標準意識文件，該文件會定期更新。

Note: The OWASP’s common attack types list contains three new risks for the years 2017 to 2021: insecure design, software and data integrity failures, and server-side request forgery.
注意：OWASP 的常見攻擊類型列表包含 2017 年至 2021 年的三個新風險：不安全的設計、軟體和資料完整性失敗，以及伺服器端請求偽造。

**Vulnerabilities**
**漏洞**

A vulnerability is a weakness that can be exploited by a threat.
漏洞是可能被威脅利用的弱點。

Therefore, organizations need to regularly inspect for vulnerabilities within their systems.
因此，組織需要定期檢查其系統內的漏洞。

Some vulnerabilities include:
一些漏洞包括：

-   ProxyLogon: A pre-authenticated vulnerability that affects the Microsoft Exchange server.
    This means a threat actor can complete a user authentication process to deploy malicious code from a remote location.
    ProxyLogon：影響 Microsoft Exchange 伺服器的預先驗證漏洞。這表示威脅行為者可以完成使用者驗證過程，以從遠端位置部署惡意程式碼。
-   ZeroLogon: A vulnerability in Microsoft’s Netlogon authentication protocol.
    An authentication protocol is a way to verify a person's identity.
    Netlogon is a service that ensures a user’s identity before allowing access to a website's location.
    ZeroLogon：Microsoft Netlogon 驗證協定中的一個漏洞。驗證協定是一種驗證個人身分的方式。Netlogon 是一項在允許存取網站位置之前確保使用者身分的服務。
-   Log4Shell: Allows attackers to run Java code on someone else’s computer or leak sensitive information.
    It does this by enabling a remote attacker to take control of devices connected to the internet and run malicious code.
    Log4Shell：允許攻擊者在其他人的電腦上執行 Java 程式碼或洩露敏感資訊。它透過使遠端攻擊者能夠控制連接到網際網路的裝置並執行惡意程式碼來做到這一點。
-   PetitPotam: Affects Windows New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM).
    It is a theft technique that allows a LAN-based attacker to initiate an authentication request.
    PetitPotam：影響 Windows 新技術區域網路 (LAN) 管理器 (NTLM)。它是一種盜竊技術，允許基於 LAN 的攻擊者發起驗證請求。
-   Security logging and monitoring failures: Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities that result in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities without the organization knowing it
    安全日誌記錄和監控失敗：不足的日誌記錄和監控功能導致攻擊者在組織不知情的情況下利用漏洞
-   Server-side request forgery: Allows attackers to manipulate a server-side application into accessing and updating backend resources.
    It can also allow threat actors to steal data.
    伺服器端請求偽造：允許攻擊者操縱伺服器端應用程式以存取和更新後端資源。它也可能允許威脅行為者竊取資料。

As an entry-level security analyst, you might work in vulnerability management, which is monitoring a system to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
作為一名初級安全分析師，您可能會從事漏洞管理工作，即監控系統以識別和減輕漏洞。

Although patches and updates may exist, if they are not applied, intrusions can still occur.
雖然可能存在修補程式和更新，但如果未應用它們，入侵仍然可能發生。

For this reason, constant monitoring is important.
因此，持續監控非常重要。

The sooner an organization identifies a vulnerability and addresses it by patching it or updating their systems, the sooner it can be mitigated, reducing the organization’s exposure to the vulnerability.
組織越早識別出漏洞並透過修補或更新其系統來解決它，就能越早減輕它，從而減少組織暴露於該漏洞的風險。
